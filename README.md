This is the frontend for a sophisticated, proof-of-concept (PoC) financial advisory platform. It's designed to showcase a unique AI-driven approach to stock analysis and provide users with personalized financial planning tools, real-time market news, and a suite of financial calculators.

## üí° The Core Innovation: AI-Driven Stock Ranking

While this repository contains the frontend, its primary purpose is to serve as the user interface for a unique backend model. The core innovation of this project is a proprietary stock analysis model that uses:

1.  **Elo Rating System:** Traditionally used for games like chess, this system is adapted to rank stocks against each other based on performance.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An RL agent is used to dynamically adjust the Elo rating parameters, allowing the system to learn and adapt to changing market conditions.

This creates a dynamic, self-improving ranking system that goes beyond traditional static analysis.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up the Supabase backend first.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later) and `npm` or `bun`.
*   A Supabase account ([supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)).

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Set Up Supabase:**
    *   Create a new project on your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Use the SQL editor to set up your database schema (tables for users, stocks, etc.).
    *   (Optional) Set up Supabase Functions if your AI/RL model runs there.

2.  **Clone the Frontend Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/iamsjeevan/finance-advisory-platform.git
    cd finance-advisory-platform
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    *(or `bun install` if you are using Bun)*

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory. You need to add your Supabase project URL and Anon Key. You can find these in your Supabase project's "API Settings".
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
